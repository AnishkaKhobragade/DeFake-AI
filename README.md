Below is a sample **`README.md`** file you can place in your GitHub repository alongside your `app.py` (and any other relevant files). It outlines the project goals, dependencies, setup, and usage instructions for your hackathon demo.

# DeepFake Detection with Groq & Prepexitiy

**A hackathon project demonstrating real-time DeepFake detection and on-the-fly model training** using Python and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). This application showcases how **Groq’s high-performance hardware** and **Prepexitiy’s advanced software** could integrate to enhance both **detection** and **training** for deepfake media.

## Features

1. **Animated UI**: Eye-catching gradient background, fade-in images, and hover scaling on buttons for a polished hackathon demo.
2. **DeepFake Detection**:  
   - Upload images or videos (JPG, PNG, MP4, MOV, etc.).  
   - Automatically analyzed for deepfake indicators.  
   - Returns classification (e.g., “Deepfake Detected”) and confidence score.
3. **Insights & Fact Check**:  
   - If deepfake is detected, the app can generate human-readable insights and optionally check claims against fact-check APIs (placeholder logic).
4. **On-the-Fly Model Training** (Demo):  
   - Each uploaded file triggers a placeholder function (`train_ai_model`) to simulate incremental model training/updates.  
   - Demonstrates how new data might be used to refine the model over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed  
- A virtual environment (recommended)  
- API keys for any external detection or fact-checking services (if you’re using them), set as environment variables or in your `api_clients.py`.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DeepFakeGroqPrepexitiy.git
   cd DeepFakeGroqPrepexitiy
   ```
2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, install key packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pillow opencv-python numpy requests
   ```

### Configuration

- If you’re using real APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Groq, Prepexitiy, or fact-check services), set the respective keys in your environment or in a `.env` file.  
- The file **`api_clients.py`** (referenced in `app.py`) should contain the logic for calling external APIs.  
- The **`train_ai_model`** function in `app.py` is a placeholder. In a real scenario, replace it with incremental training or data-logging logic.

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **Open in your browser**:  
   Streamlit will display the local URL (usually http://localhost:8501).  
3. **Upload an Image or Video**:  
   - See a preview of your media.  
   - The app analyzes it for deepfake indicators, returning classification and confidence.  
   - Additional verification, insights, and fact-check (placeholder) may appear if a deepfake is detected.  
4. **Observe Model Training**:  
   - After analysis, the app calls `train_ai_model`, simulating an on-the-fly model update.  
   - A message appears under **“Model Training”** with the placeholder result.

## Project Structure

```
DeepFakeGroqPrepexitiy/
├── app.py             # Main Streamlit app
├── api_clients.py     # API logic (e.g., analyze_media, generate_insights)
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies (if used)
├── README.md          # Project documentation (this file)
└── ...               # Any additional modules, data, or config files
```

## How It Works

1. **Streamlit UI**:  
   - Provides a file uploader and a dynamic interface with custom CSS animations.  
   - Displays detection results, insights, and additional checks.  
2. **Groq & Prepexitiy Integration** (Placeholder):  
   - `analyze_with_groq_and_prepexitiy` function in `app.py` calls `analyze_media` (from `api_clients.py`) by default.  
   - In production, replace it with the real integration logic for Groq hardware acceleration and Prepexitiy’s deepfake software.  
3. **Training on New Data** (Demo):  
   - Each file upload triggers a mock training step.  
   - In reality, you could implement online learning or store data for offline retraining.

## Customization

- **UI Theme**: Modify the CSS in `app.py` to change the gradient, animations, or layout.  
- **Model Training**: Update `train_ai_model` with actual ML code if you have a pipeline ready.  
- **APIs**: Adjust `api_clients.py` to integrate real detection endpoints or advanced fact-checking.
